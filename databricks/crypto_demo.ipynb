In the Ethereum protocol and blockchain, there is a price for each operation. In order to have anything transferred or executed by the network, you have to consume or burn Gas. Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency is Ether (ETH) and it is used to pay for computation time and transaction fees.The introductory whitepaper was originally published in 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, the project was crowdfunded during August 2014 by fans all around the world and launched in 2015. Ethereum is developed and maintained by ETHDEV with contributions from minds across the globe. There is an Ecosystem Support Program which is a branch of the Ethereum Foundation focused on supporting projects and entities within the greater Ethereum community to promote the success and growth of the ecosystem. Multiple startups work with the Ethereum blockchain covering areas in: DeFi, NFTs, Ethereum Name Service, Wallets, Scaling, etc.The launch of Ethereum is a process divided into 4 main phases: Frontier, Homestead, Metropolis and Serenity.Ethereum 2.0, also known as Serenity, is the final phase of Ethereum, it aims to solve the decentralized scaling challenge. A naive way to solve Ethereum&#39;s problems would be to make it more centralized. But decentralization is too important, as it gives Ethereum censorship resistance, openness, data privacy and near-unbreakable security.The Eth2 upgrades will make Ethereum scalable, secure, and decentralized. Sharding will make Ethereum more scalable by increasing transactions per second while decreasing the power needed to run a node and validate the chain. The beacon chain will make Ethereum secure by coordinating validators across shards. And staking will lower the barrier to participation, creating a larger – more decentralized – network.The beacon chain will also introduce proof-of-stake to Ethereum. Ethereum is moving to the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism from proof-of-work (PoW). This was always the plan as it&#39;s a key part of the community&#39;s strategy to scale Ethereum via the Eth2 upgrades. However, getting PoS right is a big technical challenge and not as straightforward as using PoW to reach consensus across the networkKeep up with Ethereum upgradesFor ETH holders and Dapp users, this has no impact whatsoever, however, for users wishing to get involved, there are ways to participate in Ethereum and future Eth2-related efforts. Get involved in Eth 2.0Blockchain data provided by: Etherchain (Main Source), Blockchair (Backup), and Etherscan (Total Supply only).",1438259812,"Ethash","PoW","Finished","/media/37746238/eth.png","/coins/eth/overview",false,{"CollateralType":"","FCA":"Exchange,Utility","CollateralInfo":"","CollateralizedAsset":"No","Industry":"Blockchain-Specific Application","Access":"Permissionless","FINMA":"Payment,Utility","CollateralizedAssetType":""},{"Weiss":{"TechnologyAdoptionRating":"A","MarketPerformanceRating":"C-","Rating":"B+"}}],["3808","LTC","Litecoin (LTC)","Litecoin","LTC","Litecoin LTC - provides faster transaction confirmations (2.5 minutes on average) and uses a memory-hard, scrypt-based mining proof-of-work algorithm to target the regular computers and GPUs most people already have - which are its main differentials to Bitcoin.

While most cryptocurrencies are created as an alternative to bitcoin, ARCH was created as a startup holding DAC whose equity is represented by a cryptographic token. The goal is to test new applications of blockchain technology as well as to model an investor-token relationship in a use-case scenario involving a real startup with palpable products and services. To improve equity fungibility, revenue from any of the holding company&#39;s products or services is to be used to purchase more tokens from the market, thereby making the holding DAC&#39;s equity token exponentially more valuable with each additional revenue stream. Although no substantial revenue has been injected into ARCH&#39;s fungibility yet, its tiered conditional access levels have created a natural self-audit system that has proven very effective when it comes to managing this pseudo-corporate setup and its investors. Value in information is trusted to investors according to their own responsibility in the pseudo-corporate structure. In this tiered setup, the amount of tokens held serves as a basis of evaluating trust and involvement with the DAC itself. This system promotes unbiased transparency by the developers and corporate responsibility on behalf of the investors. This system alone, without any major revenue stream, has already proven itself as the backbone of the current stable growth in the ARCH equity token&#39;s market cap.This unique approach opens doors for a new generation of DACs, fusing decentralized communities with traditional corporate structures using tiered conditional access levels to secure the flow of information. Although tailored to our specific ventures and “community” needs, the ARCH wallet concept is an outstanding, first-of-its-kind example for other future DACs looking to combine all relevant information and tools regarding the DAC&#39;s and its equity token in one place. ARCH is taking that concept even further and seeks to integrate the whole corporate structure into its wallet as the DAC grows. In a nutshell, Arch rearranged how investors interacted in DACs to establish healthier lines of communication while changing the financial structure so that FIAT revenue would be injected directly into the tokens fungibility instead of being distributed through dividends.Their products, services and software are inspired by bitcoin, disruptive and innovative but not interdependent.BitcoinTalk",1427213903,"Scrypt","PoS","N/A","/media/20085/arch.png","/coins/arch/overview",false,{"CollateralType":"","FCA":"","CollateralInfo":"","CollateralizedAsset":"","Industry":"","Access":"","FINMA":"","CollateralizedAssetType":""},{"Weiss":{"TechnologyAdoptionRating":"","MarketPerformanceRating":"","Rating":""}}],["4371","ARG","Argentum (ARG)","Argentum","ARG","Argentum is another fast block time coin at 32 seconds.

Transaction confirmations are fast due to the 60 second block time and the difficulty retargetting is every block based on DigiShield. The one percent premine is used in the Nautlius stabilisation fund to ensure liquidity in the market.As pointed out by the Bank of England in its Quarterly Bulletin 2014 Q3 “The Economics of Digital Currencies”, Bitcoin faces three challenges: 1) Volatility 2) Sustainability of Low Transaction Fees 3) Limitations of a Fixed Money Supply. Nautiluscoin was designed to address and eliminate the challenges faced by Bitcoin.he Nautiluscoin Stability Fund seeks to reduce volatility, while the Proof of Stake algorithm does away with the need for expensive mining equipment. Additionally, at the heart of the Proof of Stake reward calculation is an algorithmic monetary policy that adjusts money supply with demand.The Nautiluscoin economy is built on the foundation of a strong currency policy and the view that a strong economy requires a currency which preserves purchasing power. Creating a fertile environment for an economy to develop requires the continuous pursuit of stability. But the pursuit of stability is not just about reducing daily price fluctuations.For Nautiluscoin to be truly successful it must preserve and increase purchasing power. Daily price stability is important for consumers and merchants to transact, but the long run success of any currency is a function of purchasing power. If users of a currency believe that their ability to purchase goods and services in the future will be diminished then they are less likely to hold and use the currency. Therefore the most important goal for Nautiluscoin will be to maintain a strong currency with a stable and growing purchasing power.In order to accomplish its strong currency goal, Nautiluscoin will compete with economics. Traditionally central banks with a strong currency policy are charged with providing an anchor for the economy through the use of money supply targets, interest rate targets, and/or exchange rate targets. Economic history has shown that these targets require the central bank to have significant resources in order to credibly accomplish the targets. Most successful targeting policies rely on an unlimited resource which is classically the ability to print or borrow money. In the case of Nautiluscoin, the terminal money supply is fixed by the software code and there are not public debt markets to use as an interest rate targets. However, this does not mean it lacks arrows in the quiver.Because the terminal money supply is fixed and released over time we have the ability to set the growth rate of the money supply. As well, the Nautiluscoin network will be secured through proof-of-stake method which will pay interest to those who desire to hold Nautiluscoin. Finally, the mining process allows us to support the exchange rate by using mining profits to purchase Nautiluscoin.  ",1428491617,"Scrypt","PoS","N/A","/media/19822/naut.png","/coins/naut/overview",false,{"CollateralType":"","FCA":"","CollateralInfo":"","CollateralizedAsset":"","Industry":"","Access":"","FINMA":"","CollateralizedAssetType":""},{"Weiss":{"TechnologyAdoptionRating":"","MarketPerformanceRating":"","Rating":""}}],["4571","NAV","NavCoin (NAV)","NavCoin","NAV","NavCoin (NAV) is a privacy-driven PoW/PoS hybrid cryptocurrency.

Coin Magi removes the competitive nature of minting and offers an even playing field for anyone looking to issue currencies without expensive equipment. Coin Magi distinguishes itself from other counter parties by its fairness, cost effective and energy efficiency in maintaining the operation of the system.Magi (XMG) is a PoW/PoS hybrid coin (mPoW/mPoS). Magi is designed with difficulty dependent mining reward for proof-of-mining (PoW) blocks in order to put network hashrate under a certain limit. Magi at the first time implements a novel proof-of-staking mechanism, to frustrate potential attack through accumulating a large number of coins and offline staking time (read more..). Magi concentrates on the low cost in maintaining its block system, for example, through cost effective mining devices. To this end, Magi, aiming at fairness, cost effective and energy efficiency, strives for every single effort to make mining be available to everyone, and provides an even playing field for people looking to issue digital coins without expensive equipment.mPoW, the magi&#39;s proof-of-work (PoW) protocol, in addition to required computational works to be done to deter denial of service attacks, is also a network-dependent rewarding model system. The mPoW rewards participants who solve complicated cryptographical questions not only to validate transactions but also to create new blocks and generate coins. The amout of coins generated are constantly monitored by the mPoW protocol and tuned on the basis of an attraction-repulsion model: 1) incremental rewarding to stimulate network activities during passive mining phase, and 2) decremental rewarding to mitigate redundant mining sources during agressive mining phase. mPoW can effectively govern the magi&#39;s network and limit it under a certain scale, enabling the general devices to be capable of mining magi. For details - A network-dependent rewarding system: proof-of-miningmPoS, the magi&#39;s proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol, aims to achieve distributed consensus through operations in addition to mPoW. mPoS is designed such that it rejects potential attacks through accumulating a large amount of coins or offline staking time, either of which leads to security concerns. Similar to mPoW&#39;s operation, mPoS is constructed in accordance with the concept of the attraction-repulsion model. Magi hybridizes mPoW with mPoS, and integrate both consensus approaches in order to acquire benefits from the two mechanisms and create a more robust payment system.

A peer-to-peer network and blockchain providing high performance decentralised web services, powered by the spare capacity all around us.Edge was founded in 2013 as a decentralised alternative to the cloud. Originally called DADI, which stood for \"Decentralised Architecture for a Democratic Internet\", the company was renamed Edge in July 2019, taking the name of the network at the heart of the project to better reflect the evolution of the technology and its mission.A crowdsale was held in 2018 to raise funds for the delivery of the core network. Set against a five year roadmap, the crowdsale distributed $EDGE tokens to supporters and future customers.Edge&#39;s testnet - running on test.network - was launched in January 2018. The first release of the mainnet was in May 2018. The first products built on top of the Edge Network are DNS and Content Delivery, both of which are live and in production.In 2019 Edge was recognised as the “Best Edge Computing Platform” in the Future Digital Awards.In 2021 the blockchain in the network used for the tracking of network requests was extended to become a mechanism for value transfer. This introduced $XE, a coin used for value attribution within the network, operated as a layer 2 solution for Ethereum. $XE is used for the payment of services; for network staking; for the distribution of node yields; and for community governance. It is bridged to the $EDGE ERC-20 token within the Etheruem network.The project roadmaps for Edge capture the near to mid term development priorities, focused on the core network layer as well as individual services on top of the network (such as Object Storage, Edge Functions and Edge DB).Edge operates a hybrid model of proof of stake and proof of work. Proof of stake is used to help to secure the network, with a stake required to operate a node. Proof of work is used to distribute yield based on the jobs that nodes successfully complete in the network.Edge Network Technologies Limited is a not-for-profit company limited by guarantee.

These are roasted on a pan together with onions and butterfat. The dish is often seasoned with salt, pepper, marjoram, cumin, and parsley, and served with a fried egg or kraut (cabbage). Hence, gröstl is somewhat similar to the American dish called hash. The letter ‘ö’ was replaced by ‘ø’, which is a letter in the Danish alphabet that is pronounced in the same way as ‘ö’. This way, the name, like the hash function itself, contains a mix of Austrian and Danish influences. The pronunciation of Grøstl may seem challenging. If you think so, then think of the letter ‘ø’ as the ‘i’ in \"bird\".

At its core is a hybridized proof-of-work proof-of-stake (PoW/PoS) consensus system that aims to strike a balance between PoW miners and PoS voters to create a more robust notion of consensus. The project is a result of the theoretical proposals brought by proof-of-activity (PoA) and MC2 in 2013. Decred development started in April, 2014 with a single developer and expanded to include developers from btcsuite shortly thereafter.Decred is built in the spirit of open participation and we have provided below a full disclosure of the technical features of the system, wallets and mining, initial funding and distribution, project governance and development, and a group contribution timeline.Decred opted for a different funding model in an attempt to shift the risk carried by supporters to the developers of the project. Instead of asking interested parties to fund the development of the software, the developers decided to pool funds together and carry the project to completion before making it public. The consensus was that this is an ethical path given the realities of funding software development, due to the fact that the developers alone carry the risk of the project failing, whereas in the past potential users were expected to pay for coins before any code was written. We felt this was unjust.The development of Decred was funded by Company 0 and from the pockets of its developers individually. The cost of developing the project, in terms of developer pay, totals to approximately USD 250,000, which Company 0 paid to developers. An additional amount of approximately USD 165,000 has been allocated for unpaid work and individual purchases by developers. We felt that the most equitable way to handle compensation for these expenses was to perform a small premine as part of the project launch. The model is unusual in that no developer received any amount of coins for free - all coins owned by developers will either be purchased at a rate of USD 0.49 per coin from their own pockets or exchanged for work performed at the same rate.The premine consists of 8% of the total supply of 21 million coins, meaning the premine consists of 1.68 million coins. Rather than allocating the entire premine to the bring-up costs, we decided to split the premine equally between compensation for bring-up and an \"airdrop\", where we freely give an equal amount of coins to a number of airdrop participants. This means Company 0 and its developers will have put roughly USD 415,000 into the bring-up since April, 2014 and receive 4% of the total supply, 840,000 coins (at USD 0.49 per coin). The remaining 4% will be spread evenly across a list of airdrop participants as part of an effort to build the Decred network and decentralize its distribution.  Coins held by Company 0 will be used to fund its ongoing work on open-source projects, such as Decred and btcsuite.Giving away these coins in an airdrop allows us to accomplish several things at once for the project: enlarge the Decred network, further help decentralize the distribution of coins, and allow us to get coins into the hands of people who are interested in participating in the project. Decred is fundamentally about technological progress, so the airdrop will target individuals that have made contributions to advance technology in its various forms. The maximum number of airdrop participants is capped at 5,000 individuals, so we recommend registering sooner rather than later. These coins will be given away unconditionally and there is zero expectation of Decred receiving anything from you in return for these coins.Sign up for the airdrop is currently open, but the airdrop registration will commence on January 4th, 2016. People who have been selected to participate in the airdrop will receive an email that contains a link to a web registration form. This form will require airdrop participants to enter an address to which their coins can be sent. Binaries and source code will be made available so that you can generate a wallet seed and an address for your airdrop coins. Once you have entered your receiving address into the airdrop webform and submitted it, you will receive your coins on the projected launch date.Discord | YouTube",1456259345,"BLAKE256","PoW/PoS","N/A","/media/1382607/decred.png","/coins/dcr/overview",false,{"CollateralType":"","FCA":"Exchange","CollateralInfo":"","CollateralizedAsset":"No","Industry":"Financial and Insurance Activities","Access":"Permissionless","FINMA":"Payment","CollateralizedAssetType":""},{"Weiss":{"TechnologyAdoptionRating":"C+","MarketPerformanceRating":"D+","Rating":"C"}}],["16717","NAS2","Nas2Coin (NAS2)","Nas2Coin","NAS2","NAS2 is a new cryptocurrency, issued in February 2016, is based on the old NasCoin.

It was developed from the previous PoS blockchain, Xaurum (XAU) which was migrated to the Ethereum platform to lower costs and inflation associated wwith mantaining a Proof of Stake 2.0 cryptocurrency.Xaurum is a gold-backed crypto asset, that derives its value from the gold reserves maintained by the Auresco Institute, a non-profit organization created by the Xaurum team. Xaurum is meant to be used as a store of value since the gold base that backs Xaurum is always growing.The former cryptocurrency, Xaurum (XAU) had an ICO period, in which 1016 XAU coins were sold. In the RICO period, these XAU coins are exchangeable for XAUR at a 1-8000 rate. During this RICO period, anyone was also allowed to send cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies to the Auresco Institute to recieve newly created XAUR. In this smart contract system, the old PoS XAU coins that were swapped and the ones that were minted in the RICO period will be in circulation (all of these coins have been backed by gold), and the remaining supply is locked (the locked supply is not backed by gold). Xaurum users have two ways of acquiring tokens, you can earn them in the \"Goldmine\" or Mint them. When mining on the Goldmine, users are exchanging their hashpower in a multipool. The earned coins from staking and mining these cryptocurrencies are used to buy more gold and to release Xaurum that was previously locked into circulation, by backing it with the newly bought gold. The proceeds from the Multipool can also be used to buy Xaurum in an exchange and pay the miners, depending on the market value of Xaurum, mined cryptocurrencies and the gold itself. When minting new coins, users are allowed to send fiat currencies directly to the Auresco Institute in exchange for new coins. These users are called Masternodes but they do not maintain the blockchain. Instead, they are required to have a 1000 XAUR collateral (like Dash masternodes), in order to create new coins. This ensures that any fraud attempt would not be profitable for the Xaurum masternodes.Profits from running the PoW multipool and from the Minting process are sent to the Commonwealth wallet, and allow the Xaurum system to increase their gold supply at a must faster pace than the XAUR supply itself.",1470596786,"N/A","N/A","N/A","/media/351382/xaur.png","/coins/xaur/overview",false,{"CollateralType":"","FCA":"","CollateralInfo":"","CollateralizedAsset":"","Industry":"","Access":"","FINMA":"","CollateralizedAssetType":""},{"Weiss":{"TechnologyAdoptionRating":"","MarketPerformanceRating":"","Rating":""}}],["25238","BFX","BitFinex Tokens (BFX)","BitFinex Tokens","BFX","BitFinex Tokens were issued by BitFinex as obligations by the exchange for the 36% haircut on customer account after the hack in August 2016.

In the Ethereum protocol and blockchain, there is a price for each operation. In order to have anything transferred or executed by the network, you have to consume or burn Gas. Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency is Ether (ETH) and it is used to pay for computation time and transaction fees.The introductory whitepaper was originally published in 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, the project was crowdfunded during August 2014 by fans all around the world and launched in 2015. Ethereum is developed and maintained by ETHDEV with contributions from minds across the globe. There is an Ecosystem Support Program which is a branch of the Ethereum Foundation focused on supporting projects and entities within the greater Ethereum community to promote the success and growth of the ecosystem. Multiple startups work with the Ethereum blockchain covering areas in: DeFi, NFTs, Ethereum Name Service, Wallets, Scaling, etc.The launch of Ethereum is a process divided into 4 main phases: Frontier, Homestead, Metropolis and Serenity.Ethereum 2.0, also known as Serenity, is the final phase of Ethereum, it aims to solve the decentralized scaling challenge. A naive way to solve Ethereum&#39;s problems would be to make it more centralized. But decentralization is too important, as it gives Ethereum censorship resistance, openness, data privacy and near-unbreakable security.The Eth2 upgrades will make Ethereum scalable, secure, and decentralized. Sharding will make Ethereum more scalable by increasing transactions per second while decreasing the power needed to run a node and validate the chain. The beacon chain will make Ethereum secure by coordinating validators across shards. And staking will lower the barrier to participation, creating a larger – more decentralized – network.The beacon chain will also introduce proof-of-stake to Ethereum. Ethereum is moving to the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism from proof-of-work (PoW). This was always the plan as it&#39;s a key part of the community&#39;s strategy to scale Ethereum via the Eth2 upgrades. However, getting PoS right is a big technical challenge and not as straightforward as using PoW to reach consensus across the networkKeep up with Ethereum upgradesFor ETH holders and Dapp users, this has no impact whatsoever, however, for users wishing to get involved, there are ways to participate in Ethereum and future Eth2-related efforts. Get involved in Eth 2.0Blockchain data provided by: Etherchain (Main Source), Blockchair (Backup), and Etherscan (Total Supply only).</td><td>1438259812</td><td>Ethash</td><td>PoW</td><td>Finished</td><td>/media/37746238/eth.png</td><td>/coins/eth/overview</td><td>false</td><td>Map(CollateralType -> , FCA -> Exchange,Utility, CollateralInfo -> , CollateralizedAsset -> No, Industry -> Blockchain-Specific Application, Access -> Permissionless, FINMA -> Payment,Utility, CollateralizedAssetType -> )</td><td>Map(Weiss -> Map(TechnologyAdoptionRating -> A, MarketPerformanceRating -> C-, Rating -> B+))</td></tr><tr><td>3808</td><td>LTC</td><td>Litecoin (LTC)</td><td>Litecoin</td><td>LTC</td><td>Litecoin LTC - provides faster transaction confirmations (2.5 minutes on average) and uses a memory-hard, scrypt-based mining proof-of-work algorithm to target the regular computers and GPUs most people already have - which are its main differentials to Bitcoin.

While most cryptocurrencies are created as an alternative to bitcoin, ARCH was created as a startup holding DAC whose equity is represented by a cryptographic token. The goal is to test new applications of blockchain technology as well as to model an investor-token relationship in a use-case scenario involving a real startup with palpable products and services. To improve equity fungibility, revenue from any of the holding company&#39;s products or services is to be used to purchase more tokens from the market, thereby making the holding DAC&#39;s equity token exponentially more valuable with each additional revenue stream. Although no substantial revenue has been injected into ARCH&#39;s fungibility yet, its tiered conditional access levels have created a natural self-audit system that has proven very effective when it comes to managing this pseudo-corporate setup and its investors. Value in information is trusted to investors according to their own responsibility in the pseudo-corporate structure. In this tiered setup, the amount of tokens held serves as a basis of evaluating trust and involvement with the DAC itself. This system promotes unbiased transparency by the developers and corporate responsibility on behalf of the investors. This system alone, without any major revenue stream, has already proven itself as the backbone of the current stable growth in the ARCH equity token&#39;s market cap.This unique approach opens doors for a new generation of DACs, fusing decentralized communities with traditional corporate structures using tiered conditional access levels to secure the flow of information. Although tailored to our specific ventures and “community” needs, the ARCH wallet concept is an outstanding, first-of-its-kind example for other future DACs looking to combine all relevant information and tools regarding the DAC&#39;s and its equity token in one place. ARCH is taking that concept even further and seeks to integrate the whole corporate structure into its wallet as the DAC grows. In a nutshell, Arch rearranged how investors interacted in DACs to establish healthier lines of communication while changing the financial structure so that FIAT revenue would be injected directly into the tokens fungibility instead of being distributed through dividends.Their products, services and software are inspired by bitcoin, disruptive and innovative but not interdependent.BitcoinTalk</td><td>1427213903</td><td>Scrypt</td><td>PoS</td><td>N/A</td><td>/media/20085/arch.png</td><td>/coins/arch/overview</td><td>false</td><td>Map(CollateralType -> , FCA -> , CollateralInfo -> , CollateralizedAsset -> , Industry -> , Access -> , FINMA -> , CollateralizedAssetType -> )</td><td>Map(Weiss -> Map(TechnologyAdoptionRating -> , MarketPerformanceRating -> , Rating -> ))</td></tr><tr><td>4371</td><td>ARG</td><td>Argentum (ARG)</td><td>Argentum</td><td>ARG</td><td>Argentum is another fast block time coin at 32 seconds.

Transaction confirmations are fast due to the 60 second block time and the difficulty retargetting is every block based on DigiShield. The one percent premine is used in the Nautlius stabilisation fund to ensure liquidity in the market.As pointed out by the Bank of England in its Quarterly Bulletin 2014 Q3 “The Economics of Digital Currencies”, Bitcoin faces three challenges: 1) Volatility 2) Sustainability of Low Transaction Fees 3) Limitations of a Fixed Money Supply. Nautiluscoin was designed to address and eliminate the challenges faced by Bitcoin.he Nautiluscoin Stability Fund seeks to reduce volatility, while the Proof of Stake algorithm does away with the need for expensive mining equipment. Additionally, at the heart of the Proof of Stake reward calculation is an algorithmic monetary policy that adjusts money supply with demand.The Nautiluscoin economy is built on the foundation of a strong currency policy and the view that a strong economy requires a currency which preserves purchasing power. Creating a fertile environment for an economy to develop requires the continuous pursuit of stability. But the pursuit of stability is not just about reducing daily price fluctuations.For Nautiluscoin to be truly successful it must preserve and increase purchasing power. Daily price stability is important for consumers and merchants to transact, but the long run success of any currency is a function of purchasing power. If users of a currency believe that their ability to purchase goods and services in the future will be diminished then they are less likely to hold and use the currency. Therefore the most important goal for Nautiluscoin will be to maintain a strong currency with a stable and growing purchasing power.In order to accomplish its strong currency goal, Nautiluscoin will compete with economics. Traditionally central banks with a strong currency policy are charged with providing an anchor for the economy through the use of money supply targets, interest rate targets, and/or exchange rate targets. Economic history has shown that these targets require the central bank to have significant resources in order to credibly accomplish the targets. Most successful targeting policies rely on an unlimited resource which is classically the ability to print or borrow money. In the case of Nautiluscoin, the terminal money supply is fixed by the software code and there are not public debt markets to use as an interest rate targets. However, this does not mean it lacks arrows in the quiver.Because the terminal money supply is fixed and released over time we have the ability to set the growth rate of the money supply. As well, the Nautiluscoin network will be secured through proof-of-stake method which will pay interest to those who desire to hold Nautiluscoin. Finally, the mining process allows us to support the exchange rate by using mining profits to purchase Nautiluscoin.  </td><td>1428491617</td><td>Scrypt</td><td>PoS</td><td>N/A</td><td>/media/19822/naut.png</td><td>/coins/naut/overview</td><td>false</td><td>Map(CollateralType -> , FCA -> , CollateralInfo -> , CollateralizedAsset -> , Industry -> , Access -> , FINMA -> , CollateralizedAssetType -> )</td><td>Map(Weiss -> Map(TechnologyAdoptionRating -> , MarketPerformanceRating -> , Rating -> ))</td></tr><tr><td>4571</td><td>NAV</td><td>NavCoin (NAV)</td><td>NavCoin</td><td>NAV</td><td>NavCoin (NAV) is a privacy-driven PoW/PoS hybrid cryptocurrency.

It operates on the principle of allowing miners to “burn” virtual currency tokens. They are then granted the right to write blocks in proportion to the coins burnt.Balances in Counterparty’s native currency, ‘XCP’, will be initialised by ‘burning’ bitcoins in miners’ fees during a particular period of time using a burn message type. The number of XCP earned per bitcoin is calculated thus:XCP_EARNED = BTC_BURNED * (1000 * (1 + .5 *     ((END_BLOCK - CURRENT_BLOCK) / (END_BLOCK - START_BLOCK))     ))END_BLOCK is the block after which the burn period is over (block #283810) and START_BLOCK is the block with which the burn period begins (block #278310).

If you can point and click a mouse, you can use Bytecent. Unlike with other digital currencies, Bytecent does not require any special hardware or configurations to mine. Simply download the software, install it, and begin mining today! \"Mining\" is lingo for discovering new Bytecent, similar to panning for gold. In actuality, mining is simply the process used to verify Bytecent transactions on the network.There are approximately 1440 coins generated per day, so finding new Bytecent can take a few hours or a few days depending on the speed of your computer. Mining Bytecent is fun and allows anyone with no mining experience or technical knowhow to begin mining immediately! Similar to conventional currencies, Bytecent is a currency that can be used to buy goods and services.

Coin Magi removes the competitive nature of minting and offers an even playing field for anyone looking to issue currencies without expensive equipment. Coin Magi distinguishes itself from other counter parties by its fairness, cost effective and energy efficiency in maintaining the operation of the system.Magi (XMG) is a PoW/PoS hybrid coin (mPoW/mPoS). Magi is designed with difficulty dependent mining reward for proof-of-mining (PoW) blocks in order to put network hashrate under a certain limit. Magi at the first time implements a novel proof-of-staking mechanism, to frustrate potential attack through accumulating a large number of coins and offline staking time (read more..). Magi concentrates on the low cost in maintaining its block system, for example, through cost effective mining devices. To this end, Magi, aiming at fairness, cost effective and energy efficiency, strives for every single effort to make mining be available to everyone, and provides an even playing field for people looking to issue digital coins without expensive equipment.mPoW, the magi&#39;s proof-of-work (PoW) protocol, in addition to required computational works to be done to deter denial of service attacks, is also a network-dependent rewarding model system. The mPoW rewards participants who solve complicated cryptographical questions not only to validate transactions but also to create new blocks and generate coins. The amout of coins generated are constantly monitored by the mPoW protocol and tuned on the basis of an attraction-repulsion model: 1) incremental rewarding to stimulate network activities during passive mining phase, and 2) decremental rewarding to mitigate redundant mining sources during agressive mining phase. mPoW can effectively govern the magi&#39;s network and limit it under a certain scale, enabling the general devices to be capable of mining magi. For details - A network-dependent rewarding system: proof-of-miningmPoS, the magi&#39;s proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol, aims to achieve distributed consensus through operations in addition to mPoW. mPoS is designed such that it rejects potential attacks through accumulating a large amount of coins or offline staking time, either of which leads to security concerns. Similar to mPoW&#39;s operation, mPoS is constructed in accordance with the concept of the attraction-repulsion model. Magi hybridizes mPoW with mPoS, and integrate both consensus approaches in order to acquire benefits from the two mechanisms and create a more robust payment system.

Easily transferable for a quick turnover without the need of intermediary brokers, the OMC asset will be the choice dividend vehicle for investors around the globe. Biweekly dividends ensure that no matter the price of the asset, the asset owner always will receive a 0.00001% share of the dividend pool, per Omicron, every 2 weeks.How are BTC dividend-yields accrued and issued?BTC dividends will be funded every 2 weeks through trading on the volatile altcoin market as well as lending capital for margin-trading exchanges (stable interest). The loan interest guarantees a biweekly issuance of dividends, while the altcoin trading revenue is a major bonus, many times greater than loan yields. The trading yields aren&#39;t guaranteed biweekly as there may be an occurrence where there is a net loss during the timeframe. A minimum balance of 10,000 OMC in an address will be required to qualify for dividend yields. A BTC address must be associated with the OMC address, which will be done through the main website, and soon through the Omicron client itself.</td><td>1430210573</td><td>Scrypt</td><td>PoW</td><td>N/A</td><td>/media/1381967/omc.png</td><td>/coins/omc/overview</td><td>false</td><td>Map(CollateralType -> , FCA -> , CollateralInfo -> , CollateralizedAsset -> , Industry -> , Access -> , FINMA -> , CollateralizedAssetType -> )</td><td>Map(Weiss -> Map(TechnologyAdoptionRating -> , MarketPerformanceRating -> , Rating -> ))</td></tr><tr><td>5366</td><td>GIG</td><td>GigaCoin (GIG)</td><td>GigaCoin</td><td>GIG</td><td>Gigacoin is a social currency designed to be used for trading Digital Items and &#39;In-Game Transactions&#39;.GigaCoin achieves this by integrating a digital currency platform seamlessly in Various Games from RPG-based Games to Gambling and Sports Games, A Dedicated Digital MarketPlace, and Integration with all major social networks to make the process of sending and receiving money easy and fun for everyone.</td><td>1430210585</td><td>Fresh</td><td>PoW</td><td>N/A</td><td>/media/37746101/gig.png</td><td>/coins/gig/overview</td><td>false</td><td>Map(CollateralType -> , FCA -> , CollateralInfo -> , CollateralizedAsset -> , Industry -> , Access -> , FINMA -> , CollateralizedAssetType -> )</td><td>Map(Weiss -> Map(TechnologyAdoptionRating -> , MarketPerformanceRating -> , Rating -> ))</td></tr><tr><td>5367</td><td>CC</td><td>CyberCoin (CC)</td><td>CyberCoin</td><td>CC</td><td>Cybercoin is a project run by two developers - the coin is based on srypt and works with proof of stake.

A peer-to-peer network and blockchain providing high performance decentralised web services, powered by the spare capacity all around us.Edge was founded in 2013 as a decentralised alternative to the cloud. Originally called DADI, which stood for \"Decentralised Architecture for a Democratic Internet\", the company was renamed Edge in July 2019, taking the name of the network at the heart of the project to better reflect the evolution of the technology and its mission.A crowdsale was held in 2018 to raise funds for the delivery of the core network. Set against a five year roadmap, the crowdsale distributed $EDGE tokens to supporters and future customers.Edge&#39;s testnet - running on test.network - was launched in January 2018. The first release of the mainnet was in May 2018. The first products built on top of the Edge Network are DNS and Content Delivery, both of which are live and in production.In 2019 Edge was recognised as the “Best Edge Computing Platform” in the Future Digital Awards.In 2021 the blockchain in the network used for the tracking of network requests was extended to become a mechanism for value transfer. This introduced $XE, a coin used for value attribution within the network, operated as a layer 2 solution for Ethereum. $XE is used for the payment of services; for network staking; for the distribution of node yields; and for community governance. It is bridged to the $EDGE ERC-20 token within the Etheruem network.The project roadmaps for Edge capture the near to mid term development priorities, focused on the core network layer as well as individual services on top of the network (such as Object Storage, Edge Functions and Edge DB).Edge operates a hybrid model of proof of stake and proof of work. Proof of stake is used to help to secure the network, with a stake required to operate a node. Proof of work is used to distribute yield based on the jobs that nodes successfully complete in the network.Edge Network Technologies Limited is a not-for-profit company limited by guarantee.

Staking was designed originally to yield a percentage of a coinholder&#39;s total coins over time, every year, in exchange for supporting the network. Developers walk a fine line between coding high interest percentages to entice holders to stake to support the network while trying to keep the interest percentages low enough that inflation doesn&#39;t kill the coin. People have become accustomed to &#39;Mining Periods&#39; of hyper inflation where the initial coinbase is established, after which mining becomes impossible and the network relies entirely on holders to stake in order to maintain the network and process transactions. Genstake aims to change all that. With Genstake, staking blocks doesn&#39;t give you interest on the coins you already have; staking blocks gives you a full block reward. Effectively, each of your coins becomes a little mining rig on the network, working diligently to mine you more coins. Gone are the days of 0.02 coins for staking a block. Staking a block with Genstake produces 20 Gencoins. The official Genstake ticker is “GEN” and trades under that name on all the exchanges where it has been listed.

For the first 10 days, which contains the full PoW (proof of work) period, Synergy uses the X11 algorithm. Because X11 is unnecessarily inefficient after PoW, Synergy switches to SHA256d for the PoS period (proof of stake). SHA256d is easier on CPUs during syncronization and bootstrap because it requires only two hashes to verify a block whereas X11 requires 11 hashes.The early part of the Synergy PoS period makes use of Turbo Stake, which awards Synergy holders greater interest for every stake.

Digital currencies are the future and Groestlcoin will be one of the leaders in this revolution.The name \"Grøstl\" is a multilingual play-on-words, referring to an Austrian dish usually made of leftover potatoes and pork, cut into slices. These are roasted on a pan together with onions and butterfat. The dish is often seasoned with salt, pepper, marjoram, cumin, and parsley, and served with a fried egg or kraut (cabbage). Hence, gröstl is somewhat similar to the American dish called hash. The letter ‘ö’ was replaced by ‘ø’, which is a letter in the Danish alphabet that is pronounced in the same way as ‘ö’. This way, the name, like the hash function itself, contains a mix of Austrian and Danish influences. The pronunciation of Grøstl may seem challenging. If you think so, then think of the letter ‘ø’ as the ‘i’ in \"bird\". This letter is a so-called close-mid front rounded vowel.Blockchain data provided by: Blockchair (Main Source), CryptoID (Backup)Telegram | Discord | Facebook | YouTube | Reddit | MediumGroestl Specifications White Paper </td><td>1443612137</td><td>Groestl</td><td>PoW</td><td>N/A</td><td>/media/37746990/grs.png</td><td>/coins/grs/overview</td><td>false</td><td>Map(CollateralType -> , FCA -> Exchange, CollateralInfo -> , CollateralizedAsset -> No, Industry -> Financial and Insurance Activities, Access -> Permissionless, FINMA -> Payment, CollateralizedAssetType -> )</td><td>Map(Weiss -> Map(TechnologyAdoptionRating -> D+, MarketPerformanceRating -> D-, Rating -> D+))</td></tr><tr><td>13072</td><td>SC</td><td>Siacoin (SC)</td><td>Siacoin</td><td>SC</td><td>Sia is an actively developed decentralized storage platform.

That said the Crypto Asset/Token is essentially a pathway to gaining exposure to the nascent crypto space.The Obits token denominates ownership in a profit sharing arrangement between various organisations such as Openledger, CCEDK exchange, Biteaser advertising platform &amp; ShareBits. At the time of writing only openledger is actively contributing towards the Obits Token profits. Please see the technology page to understand more about how openledger profits are generated and used to buyback obits.All transactions made on the platform are verifiable on the blockchain. Any user can therefore audit the profits generated by the company in real time. Since the blockchain ensures full transparency, unlike conventional banking systems, stakeholders and shareholders will be able to ensure they are not being cheated. This will also add a novel dimension to share trading as it will allow for real time disclosure of Company revenues.The Obits buyback program will occur at regular intervals, just like government bond auctions, with the first in February 2016. The idea is that out of the 18,276,898 issued at launch the profits will then be used to reduce the number of coins in supply - like a traditional stock buyback if the number of shares is reduced then the value of each share will be increase. The opposite could be true too with dilution taking place if the network of Companies involved decides to add other Companies to its network and justify it with the addition of further OBITS. As it is a essentially a stock crossed with an affiliate agreement depending on the future profits of a group of companies - there is high levels of risk involved.

At its core is a hybridized proof-of-work proof-of-stake (PoW/PoS) consensus system that aims to strike a balance between PoW miners and PoS voters to create a more robust notion of consensus. The project is a result of the theoretical proposals brought by proof-of-activity (PoA) and MC2 in 2013. Decred development started in April, 2014 with a single developer and expanded to include developers from btcsuite shortly thereafter.Decred is built in the spirit of open participation and we have provided below a full disclosure of the technical features of the system, wallets and mining, initial funding and distribution, project governance and development, and a group contribution timeline.Decred opted for a different funding model in an attempt to shift the risk carried by supporters to the developers of the project. Instead of asking interested parties to fund the development of the software, the developers decided to pool funds together and carry the project to completion before making it public. The consensus was that this is an ethical path given the realities of funding software development, due to the fact that the developers alone carry the risk of the project failing, whereas in the past potential users were expected to pay for coins before any code was written. We felt this was unjust.The development of Decred was funded by Company 0 and from the pockets of its developers individually. The cost of developing the project, in terms of developer pay, totals to approximately USD 250,000, which Company 0 paid to developers. An additional amount of approximately USD 165,000 has been allocated for unpaid work and individual purchases by developers. We felt that the most equitable way to handle compensation for these expenses was to perform a small premine as part of the project launch. The model is unusual in that no developer received any amount of coins for free - all coins owned by developers will either be purchased at a rate of USD 0.49 per coin from their own pockets or exchanged for work performed at the same rate.The premine consists of 8% of the total supply of 21 million coins, meaning the premine consists of 1.68 million coins. Rather than allocating the entire premine to the bring-up costs, we decided to split the premine equally between compensation for bring-up and an \"airdrop\", where we freely give an equal amount of coins to a number of airdrop participants. This means Company 0 and its developers will have put roughly USD 415,000 into the bring-up since April, 2014 and receive 4% of the total supply, 840,000 coins (at USD 0.49 per coin). The remaining 4% will be spread evenly across a list of airdrop participants as part of an effort to build the Decred network and decentralize its distribution.  Coins held by Company 0 will be used to fund its ongoing work on open-source projects, such as Decred and btcsuite.Giving away these coins in an airdrop allows us to accomplish several things at once for the project: enlarge the Decred network, further help decentralize the distribution of coins, and allow us to get coins into the hands of people who are interested in participating in the project. Decred is fundamentally about technological progress, so the airdrop will target individuals that have made contributions to advance technology in its various forms. The maximum number of airdrop participants is capped at 5,000 individuals, so we recommend registering sooner rather than later. These coins will be given away unconditionally and there is zero expectation of Decred receiving anything from you in return for these coins.Sign up for the airdrop is currently open, but the airdrop registration will commence on January 4th, 2016. People who have been selected to participate in the airdrop will receive an email that contains a link to a web registration form. This form will require airdrop participants to enter an address to which their coins can be sent. Binaries and source code will be made available so that you can generate a wallet seed and an address for your airdrop coins. Once you have entered your receiving address into the airdrop webform and submitted it, you will receive your coins on the projected launch date.Discord | YouTube</td><td>1456259345</td><td>BLAKE256</td><td>PoW/PoS</td><td>N/A</td><td>/media/1382607/decred.png</td><td>/coins/dcr/overview</td><td>false</td><td>Map(CollateralType -> , FCA -> Exchange, CollateralInfo -> , CollateralizedAsset -> No, Industry -> Financial and Insurance Activities, Access -> Permissionless, FINMA -> Payment, CollateralizedAssetType -> )</td><td>Map(Weiss -> Map(TechnologyAdoptionRating -> C+, MarketPerformanceRating -> D+, Rating -> C))</td></tr><tr><td>16717</td><td>NAS2</td><td>Nas2Coin (NAS2)</td><td>Nas2Coin</td><td>NAS2</td><td>NAS2 is a new cryptocurrency, issued in February 2016, is based on the old NasCoin.

Users can use steem power to upvote content and get curating rewards.When a user upvotes content his steem power gets depleted and then slowly regenerated. Steem Power holders recieve interest from their holdings. The more Steem Power a voter has the more revenue he&#39;ll generate for himself (in form of SP) and for the content creator  (In SBD).There is also an incentive to upvote content early, as the rewards are distributed according to time. The earliest votes gets the biggest share of the reward.Steem Backed Dollars are there to protect content creators from volatitlity and can be traded for roughly 1 usd worth of steem, in order to cash out from steem. Converting Steem backed dollars into STEEM takes 5 days. Users also recieve interest from holding SBD. TSteem is a proof of work currency with a scheduled blocktime of 3 seconds. Steem PoW mining is done in rounds of 63 seconds by 21 miners (witnesses). 19 of the miners are pre voted, one is the other with the most computational power, and the last one is selected from a queue of witnesses that did not get on the top 19 voted witnesses.90% of the block reward is allocated to a vest fund to reward curators and PoW miners, the other 10% are made liquid in the form of steem and are used to reward content creators.

This ensures that your purchases, receipts, and all transfers remain absolutely private by default. Using the power of a distributed peer-to-peer consensus network, every transaction on the network is cryptographically secured.

Wallet files are encrypted with a passphrase to ensure they are useless if stolen.

The difficulty starts low to give CPU miner a chance but adjusts quickly. Later, when the network is secure and thriving, Uther will shift to proof-of-stake. There is a premine for development and marketing: bounties, rewards, etc. Both are secured by smart contracts to ensure they will be used for the long-term good of Uther. The total premine is 12 million because other clones with smaller premines ran into trouble. Uther is here for the long term. Its total supply will be the same as Ethereum&#39;s.Central to Uther is the smart contract. As a platform, Uther has the same functionality as Ethereum. Because it is new, it provides a testbed to write smart contract much more cheaply than with Ethereum. As a community grows, the ecosystem grows with it. As the ecosystem grows, smart contract field becomes lusher. The more lush the field, the more useful Uther is! A virtuous circle.Smart contracts, as many knows, will change the world. They will enable digital purchases, with digital keys sent to the buyer from a smart contract. They will enable smart auctions, with the winning buyer notified and even served with delivery from a smart contract. They will enable price feeds, either trustless through Guildencoin algorithm or always open to public inspection. These feeds, inspectable at will through the data from websites, will spawn market of derivatives. The first derivative will be simple, like the contract for differences, but the ecosystem growing lush will lead to more complex ones.

It was developed from the previous PoS blockchain, Xaurum (XAU) which was migrated to the Ethereum platform to lower costs and inflation associated wwith mantaining a Proof of Stake 2.0 cryptocurrency.Xaurum is a gold-backed crypto asset, that derives its value from the gold reserves maintained by the Auresco Institute, a non-profit organization created by the Xaurum team. Xaurum is meant to be used as a store of value since the gold base that backs Xaurum is always growing.The former cryptocurrency, Xaurum (XAU) had an ICO period, in which 1016 XAU coins were sold. In the RICO period, these XAU coins are exchangeable for XAUR at a 1-8000 rate. During this RICO period, anyone was also allowed to send cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies to the Auresco Institute to recieve newly created XAUR. In this smart contract system, the old PoS XAU coins that were swapped and the ones that were minted in the RICO period will be in circulation (all of these coins have been backed by gold), and the remaining supply is locked (the locked supply is not backed by gold). Xaurum users have two ways of acquiring tokens, you can earn them in the \"Goldmine\" or Mint them. When mining on the Goldmine, users are exchanging their hashpower in a multipool. The earned coins from staking and mining these cryptocurrencies are used to buy more gold and to release Xaurum that was previously locked into circulation, by backing it with the newly bought gold. The proceeds from the Multipool can also be used to buy Xaurum in an exchange and pay the miners, depending on the market value of Xaurum, mined cryptocurrencies and the gold itself. When minting new coins, users are allowed to send fiat currencies directly to the Auresco Institute in exchange for new coins. These users are called Masternodes but they do not maintain the blockchain. Instead, they are required to have a 1000 XAUR collateral (like Dash masternodes), in order to create new coins. This ensures that any fraud attempt would not be profitable for the Xaurum masternodes.Profits from running the PoW multipool and from the Minting process are sent to the Commonwealth wallet, and allow the Xaurum system to increase their gold supply at a must faster pace than the XAUR supply itself.</td><td>1470596786</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td><td>/media/351382/xaur.png</td><td>/coins/xaur/overview</td><td>false</td><td>Map(CollateralType -> , FCA -> , CollateralInfo -> , CollateralizedAsset -> , Industry -> , Access -> , FINMA -> , CollateralizedAssetType -> )</td><td>Map(Weiss -> Map(TechnologyAdoptionRating -> , MarketPerformanceRating -> , Rating -> ))</td></tr><tr><td>25238</td><td>BFX</td><td>BitFinex Tokens (BFX)</td><td>BitFinex Tokens</td><td>BFX</td><td>BitFinex Tokens were issued by BitFinex as obligations by the exchange for the 36% haircut on customer account after the hack in August 2016.

CraftCoin was designed to be a portable in-game currency for Minecraft servers. The currency is used to buy in-game items on Minecraft servers and can be instantly transferred to any other Minecraft server that supports CraftCoin. The reason this coin was made is: Prior to the spike in the value of LTC, I ran a successful Minecraft server that used LTC as an in-game currency. The sudden spike in value caused a \"bank run\" and suddenly people stopped playing on the server due to hyperinflation. This coin aims to solve this problem, since the value of a CraftCoin will be based on what players are willing to pay for in-game items, rather than being tied to a coin with fluctuating value. CraftCoin is not intended to be a competitor with Bitcoin, Litecoin, or any other currency. It&#39;s one and only purpose is simply being a game currency that is protected from wild price swings that cause inflation/deflation on Minecraft servers and yet remains portable across any group of servers that wish to adopt the currency.The official Craftcoin ticker is “CRAFT” and trades under that name on all the exchanges where it has been listed.
